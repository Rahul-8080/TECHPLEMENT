I have developed a basic weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This user-friendly app allows users to check the current weather conditions for any location. By entering the name of a city, users can view real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief weather description. The application fetches weather data from a reliable API, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information. The clean and intuitive interface, designed with CSS, provides a pleasant user experience. This project showcases fundamental web development skills and serves as a foundation for more advanced weather applications.
